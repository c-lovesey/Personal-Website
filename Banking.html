                    The banking application is a Java based application which uses multiple csv files to store user data, this was chosen
                    over a conventional sql server as there were connection issues with the server.

            <div class="card">
              <img src="/"/>
              <div class="card-content">
                <p>
                    The application includes a simple text based user interface which allows for easy 
                    switching between different account functions and quick input in the required fields.
                    There are 3 different types of accounts which the user can create and manage, these are Personal, Business and ISA.
                    Each account has a different requirement such as fees, overdraft and interest rates which had to be implemented for each type of account.

                  <p>
                     The final result of the project is an easy to use text based application which allows for the searching, creating and editing of user data.
